# Raw Accel - User Inteface Working Branch

This branch will contain work to create a modern user interface for the Raw Accel driver using Avalonia.

## Why use a working branch?
Only code which is ready to be released will be merged to master. This branch will be merged to master once we are satisfied with the new UI.

## ReadMe

This ReadMe will contain information on how to contribute to the working branch. It will be updated back to the standard Raw Accel readme on final merge to master before release.

## Building

To build the solution for RA with the new user interface, you need the same prerequisites as master, and one additional:
- .NET VS installations -4.7.2, 8.0
- Desktop development with C++ (VS installer component package)
- Windows SDK for your Windows installation version
- Windows Driver Development Kit (WDK) for your Windows installation version
- [Avalonia Templates and VSIX](https://avaloniaui.net/gettingstarted#installation)

## Project Planning

The GitHub Project used to plan this work can be found here: [User Interface 2.0 with Avalonia](https://github.com/orgs/RawAccelOfficial/projects/2)  
That project has a ReadMe with additional info.
